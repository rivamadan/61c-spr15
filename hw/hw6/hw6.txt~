======= Problem 1 =======
a. 32 bits
b. 2^59
c. 2^27 (physical memory size / page size)

======= Problem 2 =======
a. N/8 + 3
b. 40

======= Problem 3 =======
Access times [stays the same] (Choose one.)
Explanation: We still have to access memory/disk after we go through 8 integers in the array because a page only brings in 8 integers. Unrolling would only reduce time spent checking branches.

======= Problem 4 =======
a. 2^13 B (page size)
b. 2 (# of rows in page table/# of pages per process)
